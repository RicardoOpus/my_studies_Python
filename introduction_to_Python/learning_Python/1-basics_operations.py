# Assign values to a name:

print('Square root of 25 add 1 = ', square_root + 1)


# Increment:
counter = 0
counter = counter + 1
print(counter)
# Or simple:
counter += 1


# Basic operators:
# And:
temperature = 20
print('The temperature is between 18 and 25? ', temperature < 25 and temperature > 18)
# Or simple:
18 < temperature > 25
# Or:
age = 15
print('The age is less or equals to 5, or age is greater or equals to 65? ', age <= 5 or age >= 65)
